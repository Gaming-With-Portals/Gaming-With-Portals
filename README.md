# I'm Gaming With Portals
However, that's a mouthful, so GWP or Portals is typically what others call me, feel free to do the same!

I am a software engineer with a big focus on WinUI and WPF applications, as well as game development with my own custom 2D engine [XE]ngine
I consider myself fully fluent in Python, C#, and GDScript,
I am semi-fluent in Java, Lua, C++ and ASM
