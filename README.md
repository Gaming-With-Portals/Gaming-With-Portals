# I'm Gaming With Portals
However, that's a mouthful, so "GWP" or "Portals" is typically what others call me, feel free to do the same!

### About me:
I am a software engineer with a big focus on desktop applications and game tooling, either with Windows Forms with C#, Godot with GDScript, or ImGui with C++, as well as game development with my own custom 2D engine: [XE]ngine

### Languages:
I consider myself fully fluent in Python, C#, C++ and GDScript,
I am semi-fluent in Java, Lua and ASM
